Spectrum Scale GUi Install
==========================

This section covers installing the GUI on a node.
It assumes that the core Spectrum Scale RPMs have already been installed.
To run this node needs to be a member of a GPFS cluster; however this node need not be an NSD server.

Performance Metrics
-------------------
To display performance data this GUI node will talk to a node where `gpfs.gss.pmcollector` is installed
which in turn gets data from cluster nodes that have `gpfs.gss.pmsensors` installed.

Proceedure
----------

    yum -y install postgresql-server
    yum -y install nmap-ncat
    yum -y install boost-regex

    
    cd /usr/lpp/mmfs/4.2.0.0/
    rpm -i zimon_rpms/gpfs.gss.pmcollector-*.rpm
    rpm -i gpfs_rpms/gpfs.gui-*.rpm

On nodes that can sense things (eg on an NSD server) install the package

    rpm -i ./zimon_rpms/gpfs.gss.pmsensors-4.2.0-0.el7.x86_64.rpm


A note on the depenancies:
   * postgresql-server
       * Database
   * nmap-ncat 
      *provides /usr/bin/nc "Ncat is a feature-packed networking utility which reads and writes data across networks from the command line."
   * boost-regex 
      "Run-Time component of boost regular expression library". Boost is a set of open source C++ libraries.
      
      
      
      
      Adding additonal performance metrics
      ------------------------------------
      
The collector can be any node on the system. All sensors will report to this node. Select any node in the system to be the collector node and
modify the /opt/IBM/zimon/ZIMonSensors.cfg file. This file starts out as an empty file

#### Monitoring NFS performance

   vi  /opt/IBM/zimon/ZIMonSensors.cfg
If you are running the NFS protocol and want NFS metrics then include the following:
```
{
# NFS Ganesha statistics
name = "NFSIO"
period = 1
type = "Generic"
},
```

Note that the defaults/ directory already contains a copy of this file and this includes
```
{
        # NSF Ganesha statistics
        name = "NFSIO"
        period = 0
        type = "Generic"
        proxyCmd ="/opt/IBM/zimon/GaneshaProxy"
        restrict = "cesNodes"
}
```
Note that period of 0 seconds is the quick qay to disable a performance metric.

We also need
```
collectors =
{
        host = "t11vm71"
        port = "4739"
}
```
This is the hostname of the node where the pmcollectors rom has been installed.
> When using 'mmperfmon' to configure ZIMon in a GPFS cluster, then the
collectors are chosen based on the colRedundancy setting and the given set of
collector nodes.



#### Monitoring the Swift Object interface

To enable performance monitoring for Object, install the pmswift rpm:

    rpm -ivh pmswift-<version>-<release>.noarch.rpm

where <version> is equal to or greater than 4.2 and <release> is equal to or greater than 0.
The installation of the pmswift rpm also copies SWIFT related sensors configuration files, namely, SwiftAccount.cfg, SwiftContainer.cfg, SwiftObject.cfg and SwiftProxy.cfg to the Performance
Monitoring toolâ€™s installation directory, /opt/IBM/zimon/. The pmswift rpm converts the operational
metrics for Object into a form that is usable by the Performance Monitoring tool.
